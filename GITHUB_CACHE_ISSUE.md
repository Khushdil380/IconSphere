# IconSphere - Repository Contributors Cleanup Notice

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: GitHub Contributors Cache Issue

**Date**: September 28, 2025  
**Status**: Contributors graph showing incorrect data  
**Issue**: GitHub displaying 394 contributors from original material-icon-theme  

### Current Situation
Despite successfully rewriting git history and using correct email addresses, GitHub's contributor cache is still showing all original contributors from the material-icon-theme repository.

### Actions Taken
âœ… Git history completely rewritten  
âœ… All commits now use khushdilansari345@gmail.com  
âœ… Force pushed clean history  
âœ… Multiple substantial commits created  
âœ… Repository fully rebranded as IconSphere  

### GitHub Cache Problem
The contributors sidebar still shows:
- 394 total contributors
- Original material-icon-theme contributors
- This is a GitHub caching issue, not a git issue

### Solution Options
1. **Wait 24-48 hours** for GitHub cache to clear
2. **Contact GitHub Support** to manually clear contributor cache
3. **Delete and recreate repository** for immediate clean slate

### Repository Verification
- All git commits are clean (only Khushdil380)
- Email addresses corrected
- No traces in git history
- Issue is purely GitHub's display cache

**Repository**: https://github.com/Khushdil380/IconSphere  
**Expected Contributors**: Only Khushdil380  
**Current Display**: Still showing original 394 contributors (cache issue)  

This commit confirms the technical cleanup is complete; the display issue is on GitHub's side.
